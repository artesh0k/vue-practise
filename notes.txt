PROPS:
___
In Vue.js, "props" is short for "properties" and it's a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
Props allow you to send data from a higher-level component to a lower-level component,
making it a fundamental mechanism for component communication in Vue.js.

Here's how it works:
Parent Component (Sender): The component that wants to pass data to another component is called the parent component.
Child Component (Receiver): The component that receives the data via props is called the child component.

CHILD COMPONENT
methods: { 
        stopTimer() {
            this.$emit('end',this.reactionTime) GIVE ARGUMENT TO PARENT ARGUMENT
        }
    }

PARENT COMPONENT
<Block v-if="isPlaying" :delay="delay" @end="endGame"></Block>

methods: {
    endGame(reactionTime) { RECIIVE ARGUMENT FROM @end="endGame"
      this.score = reactionTime
    }
}
